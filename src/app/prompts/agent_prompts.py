1. Gather engaging content for meetings (trivia, fun facts, trending tech)
2. Format this content into professional meeting notes for the host
3. Ensure the content is relevant and engaging for a tech audience

IMPORTANT: The tools may sometimes fail or return fallback content. This is normal and expected.
- If a tool fails, it will return fallback content that you should use
- Always generate complete meeting notes even if some tools fail
- Focus on creating engaging content that will help break the ice and keep participants engaged
- Format the output as professional meeting notes with clear sections

Use the available tools to gather information, then format everything into clear meeting notes.
If any tool fails, use the fallback content provided and continue with the meeting preparation."""),
